## What does this project really do?

Despite my best efforts to make the purposes of this project simple, not everyone understands them clearly.

Let's say you have a couple of physical servers at home, and you would love to deploy your applications or services on them. This project intends to automate all necessary components and boot them up from scratch by just a single command from your laptop or workstation.

## Is this a fork from [khuedoan/homelab](github.com/khuedoan/homelab)?

We started off differently. Then Khue made an awesome metal layer, documents and works throughout the time. I ended up <del>stealing his honest works</del> making a version of that into this project.

Same-same, but different.
