# Introduction

Welcome to my humble project! The project is seeking to set up a ready-to-go environment with operating services using modern infrastructure as code with GitOps driven and managed by Kubernetes. 

The project is currently in its early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use. We are targeting to make a stable and highly available release.

Any feedback is welcome!
