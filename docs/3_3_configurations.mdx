# Configurations

## Domain setting

The setting for the main domain that would be used for all ingresses located at `{root}/bootstrap/values-<env>.yaml`. 

```
global:
  domain: "maibaloc.com"
```

Set the `global.domain` value to the domain that you own.

> TODO: Update DNS setup

## Inventory

The collection of metal nodes we utilized for the Ansible will need to be defined. Update the './metal/inventories/prod.ini' file with the information you got in the previous step:

```
[metal:children]
masters
workers

[masters]
metal0 ansible_host=<desired_ip_0> mac='<mac_address_0>'
metal1 ansible_host=<desired_ip_1> mac='<mac_address_1>'
metal2 ansible_host=<desired_ip_2> mac='<mac_address_2>'

[workers]
metal3 ansible_host=<desired_ip_3> mac='<mac_address_3>'
```

## Cloudflare Terraform

The `global` layer uses the [Cloudflare provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) for creating Tunnel resources and secrets.

Sign up for a free Cloudflare account.

Then you can generate the API token by access to this page: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens then create a token with the following permissions:

```
This API token will affect the below accounts and zones, along with their respective permissions
├──All accounts - Argo Tunnel:Edit, Access: Service Tokens:Edit, Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups:Edit, Access: Apps and Policies:Edit
└── All zones - Zone Settings:Edit, Zone:Edit, DNS:Edit
```

You can now set all the required inputs:

```
cloudflare_account_id = "<cloudflare_account_id>"

cloudflare_api_key = "<generated_token>"

cloudflare_email = "<your_cloudflare_email>"
```

## Applications

The setups for all applications are straightforward and basic in general; they are all defined in YAML format (in the `values.yaml` files) and are comparable in nature.

Take Istio deployment as an example:

``` yaml
istio:
  enabled: true
  namespace: istio-system
  gateway:
    enabled: false
```

> The above lines indicate that we want Istio to be deployed in the 'istio-system' namespace without the Istio gateway.
