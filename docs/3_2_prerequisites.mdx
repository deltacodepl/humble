# Prerequisites

## Initial controller

> The initial controller is the machine that bootstraps the cluster; it only needs to be used once, thus you can use your laptop or desktop for it. 

We primarily developed this project on a Linux system that could Docker with the host networking driver (which implies only Docker on Linux hosts; if you're on macOS or Windows, you can utilize a Linux virtual machine with bridged networking).

On this machine, the following packages are required:
- docker
- make
- virtualbox (if you were running the controller via a virtual machine)

## Servers

Servers, also known as metals or nodes in this document, are the machines that run the main workload.

### Hardware specifications

Any modern `x86_64` computer(s) should work, you can use old PCs, laptops or servers.

> These are the requirements for _each_ node

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| Hard drive | 64 GB | 128 GB or more (depending on your storage usage, the base installation will not use more than 64GB) |
| Node count | 1 | 3 or more for high availability |

### BIOS settings

This is something you'll have to perform for all of your servers.

For your convenience, I've included a setting-as-yaml of my BIOS settings. You'll need to adjust it to your hardware because your motherboard may have a different name for the options.

``` yaml
Devices:
  NetworkSetup:
    PXEIPv4: true
    PXEIPv6: false
Advanced:
  CPUSetup:
    VT-d: true
Power:
  AutomaticPowerOn:
    WoL: Automatic  # Use network boot if Wake-on-LAN
Security:
  SecureBoot: false
Startup:
  CSM: false
```

### Gather information step

You may need to gather the following information beforehand for the next step:

- MAC address for each machine (**required** )
- OS disk name (for example `/dev/sda`)
- Network interface name (usually, the default should be `eth0`)
- Arrange the static IP addresses for your machines when they spin up

## Sign up for Cloudflare account

We also use Cloudflare which is a full-featured DNS and web experience optimization solution. For this setup, all we need is a free account.
