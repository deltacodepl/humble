# Configurations

## Domain settings

The setting for the main domain that would be used for all ingresses located at `{root}/bootstrap/values-<env>.yaml`. 

```
global:
  domain: "maibaloc.com"
```

Set the `global.domain` value to the domain that you own.

## Terraform providers

### Cloudflare

The `global` layer uses the [Cloudflare provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) for creating Tunnel resources and secrets.

Sign up for a free Cloudflare account.

Then you can generate the API token by access to this page: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens then create a token with the following permissions:

```
This API token will affect the below accounts and zones, along with their respective permissions
├──All accounts - Argo Tunnel:Edit, Access: Service Tokens:Edit, Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups:Edit, Access: Apps and Policies:Edit
└── All zones - Zone Settings:Edit, Zone:Edit, DNS:Edit
```

You can now set all the required inputs:

```
cloudflare_account_id = "<cloudflare_account_id>"

cloudflare_api_key = "<generated_token>"

cloudflare_email = "<your_cloudflare_email>"
```
