# Humble Project

## Overview

Humble is a project that seeks to set up a ready-to-go environment with operating services using modern infrastructure as code with GitOps driven.

Let's say you have a couple of physical servers at home, and you would love to deploy your applications or services on them with Kubernetes platform. This project intends to automate all necessary components and boot them up from scratch by just a single command from your laptop or workstation.

## Core Features

- Fully automated with infrastructure as code
- Modularized components stand on layered architecture
- Versioned and declarative infrastructure on top of GitOps
- Supports data-driven deployment for multiple environments

## Documentation

See the [docs](https://humble.maibaloc.com) for detailed information on the architecture, installation and use of the platform.

For getting started:

- [Try it out locally](/getting-started/development/) without any hardware.
- [Deploy on real hardware](/getting-started/production/overview) for production workload.
