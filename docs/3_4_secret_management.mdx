# Secret Management

We manage secrets with Vault and exposing them with external-secrets workers. 

## Vault initialization and secret generations

The [vault_init.py](https://github.com/locmai/humble/blob/main/platform/files/vault_init.py) script will handle all of the Vault initialization, auto-unseal activities, and secret generation. We only run this script once when the system is first bootstrapped. These init secrets are only partially declarative and managed by external-secrets set.

![secrets provisioning flow](https://imagedelivery.net/34xh1sPWPAwO1lv63pW2Eg/362283b7-3825-4fb0-7c6d-48a55a3c9400/public)


As previously stated, the **vault_init.py** script will initialize and unseal Vault, resulting in a Kubernetes secret containing the shared keys and root token. Then, on Vault, enable Kubernetes authentication, create a read-only policy, and link it to the external-secrets service account. After that, enter all of the init secrets into Vault. The external-secrets pods with the service account will be able to read and provide Kubernetes secrets fetched from Vault.

## Declarative secret management

For partially declarative secret management, we store the secrets in Vault and define the manifests under [ExternalSecrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets) resources, the external-secrets workers will pick these up and provision them as Kubernetes secrets.

Secret management mechanism that is fully declarative has not been implemented.

**TODO:** Add a note on why choosing Vault + external-secrets
